so... ttys don't work on Bash on Windows calling docker.exe
So! The plan is now to install gnome-terminal and x11 forward that.
windows will need custom aliases that don't have -t options
everyone will need a new uavad/uavaD option (d opens tty - not for windows/D opens gnome-terminal via X11)
xeyes should be part of the image bc it's handy
gnome-terminal should be configured properly within the image (not chsh, but just add a profile)
there should be aliases within the container (uava, uavai, uavas are probably enough)

windows setup will be more complicated:
    we need to modify the xming settings to allow connections from the docker (running in -ac mode is scary)
    we need to intelligently set the DISPLAY variable for the container based on what the docker virtual interface is set to at install time (lil bit tricky, but they seem to start with 10. at least)
    we should probably look into making a start menu entry to open gnome-terminal (or xming + docker start + gnome-terminal) because that makes it v v easy for windows users (none of this hacky open bash, open another terminal or powershell business)
         ^ this is definitely a future/feature kind of thing though

linux is and remains flawless

and as for macOS, we just need to grab the host boot2docker VM's IP using docker-machine ip (and change the last digit to a 1 for the gateway) and set that to the DISPLAY variable at install time
I suspect that may work for windows as well
Also, we need to install socat and xquartz (these are straightforward enough that I don't have an issue installing these as part of the install script)
and change the start alias for macOS to also start socat

I think, our dependencies right now are as follows:
macOS: brew & a good shell & the xcode thing & the docker toolbox (not worth trying to auto install this)
      we'll install xquartz and socat if they're missing
linux: docker & a good shell?
      linux is pretty straight forward
windows: docker (regular or kitematic - need to test kitematic/toolbox) & bash on windows & xming
      not going to attempt to auto install anything on windows

And all of this will be release 0.1.0
the auto install stuff/convenient shortcuts can be a future release
